    This popup can happen when the user has the 'Studio' plugin enabled but the user is not actually part of the team or assigned to a project. I'll work out a better method of sourcing the config files to avoid this.

<Card title="Permissions Error on Project Config Alterations" img="/images/prism/slack/known_bugs_project_config_permissions.webp">
    Like the Studio Config Alterations bug, this can happen when the user has the 'Studio' plugin enabled but the user is not part of the team or assigned a project. A fix for this should come in a future update.
