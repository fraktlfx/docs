### Standard
All notifications will popup to their respected channels and let everyone know that there is an incoming update for renders. 
This will look relatively the same based on the option for Channel or Direct messages.

### Ephemeral
Notifications sent Ephemerally will post to the channel or direct messages and look like this. This lets only the user who got notified see the post.
