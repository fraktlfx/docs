## Status
### Work in Progress
The work in progress post when Approvals is enabled will show up like the standard publish. There will be virutally no changes, with the exception
of the metadata applied to the post.

### Request Review
If the Approvals options are enabled, this is how your slack post will come across.

## Button Interactivity
### Approved
When you press the ‘Approved’ button in the approvals section of the message block, it will post to the message block as a thread this message:

    className="rounded-lg"
/>
  
The person who pressed the button will be the one tagged in the threaded post as the Approver.

### Needs Revised
  
When you press the ‘Needs Revised’ option, you will be prompted with a modal, that will allow you to leave comments that need to be addressed. This is what that window will look like:

    className="rounded-lg"
/>
  
After you have submitted the notes, it will also create a threaded post to the message block letting you know who marked it as this status, and post the notes that need to be addressed in the bottom of the adjusted status.

### CBB
The CBB button will do the same thing as the Needs Revised option.
