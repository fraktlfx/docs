<Warning>Please understand that this could change significantly to allow for more flexibility in development and maintenance</Warning>
  

## Plugin API
All the commands in this categery are commands I've made accessible to the dev/user, what arguments they take, and what they accomplish. This is by no means all of them, 
it’s just what I felt was the more important commands without the need for diving deep into it. In this you should find several things: 
1. Name of the command
2. Required arguments for calling the function (if any)
3. Description of the command 
4. An example of the function in action
5. What type of response it gives back (if any)
6. The location where you can find it in the plugin
  
  

## Extending the Bolt Server Functions
These are examples of things you can include in the Bolt Server file to have more interaction with Slack. I’m not going to post whole functions here, unless necessary, 
but give you an idea of where to put and what you will need. 
  

### Create Project on Slack Channel Creation
In order to do this, you'll need to go to this file:
> [SLACK_PLUGIN_DIRECTORY]/Scripts/server/events.py
  
For this particular setting, we are creating a Project when a Slack channel gets created. However, we are filtering out the first two characters to ensure that it doesn’t 
just create projects willy-nilly. We are taking the name of the channel and using it to create a Project at the designated location along with the Prism Preset. If you have a preset, 
you can input it as a string in that location.

```python /Scripts/server/events.py lines icon="python"
@self.app.event("channel_created")
def event_channel_created(ack, event, say):
    ack()

    channel_name = event["channel"]["name"].upper()
    ...
    (Request Block)
    ...

    if '25' in channel_name[:2]:
        path = f"{PATH_TO_PROJECTS}/{channel_name}"
        self.core.projects.createProject(channel_name, path, preset="WF")
```
