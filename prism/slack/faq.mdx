            **Team**
            > This was taken out in favor of larger plans. I plan to include some options for Usersgroups with the Teams option, but it will take time.

<Accordion title="Can I mix licensed and non-licensed versions of Prism+?">

<Accordion title="How are you determining the conversion process?">
    To make things simple, any time you have more than one frame, it will be turned into an MP4 to be uploaded to slack. You can see a relatively complete breakdown here: [State Manager - Conversion](/prism/slack/integration/state-manager#conversion)
