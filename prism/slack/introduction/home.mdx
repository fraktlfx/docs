Originally developed at Warm & Fuzzy, now continuing development through FRAKTL, 
this plugin was made to make it easer for artists to upload that media from Prism to Slack without having to do it manually. 

You will need to do some things before you set it up, like installing Slackâ€™s Bolt and SDK packages.
You can find a requirements.txt file on the GitHub repository listing which versions you will need as well.
