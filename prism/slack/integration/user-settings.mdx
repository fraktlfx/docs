There is only one field for the User Settings currently  
<Note>You will need to input your Display Name from Slack</Note>  
  
  
**Why your Display Name and not your Prism username or your Real Name?**
Display names are more inclusive to the user for one, but life can throw some haymakers along the way as well so I would rather be accommodating to that then not. 
Second, Prism usernames are never going to be the same unless you specifically made it the same when working with your artists.
