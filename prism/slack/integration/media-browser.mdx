The Slack plugin currently allows you to send content directly from the Media Browser to the appropriate slack channel. Below will outline how you would do that 
and some caveats to take note of at the bottom.

## Media Browser
In order to access the menu to publish via the Media Browser, you will need to open the context menu by Right-clicking over the thumbnail of the video or 
content you are trying to publish to Slack. At the bottom you will find the ‘Publish to Slack’ option. 
<img
    src="/images/prism/slack/media_browser_publish_option.webp"
    className="rounded-lg"
    />

When you have selected the option to publish, you will be presented with a couple windows. The primary one will be the ‘Slack Publish Information’ 
window that which will allow you to leave additional comments.
<img
    src="/images/prism/slack/media_browser_publish_comments.webp"
    className="rounded-lg"
    />

You will now wait for the file to be uploaded to Slack. The smaller the file, the faster it is and vice versa.  
  
While it is being uploaded you will be presented with a temporary window letting you know that it’s uploading to Slack. Once it has completed, it will publish 
the content to the appropriate channel and leave you with this popup

    src="/images/prism/slack/media_browser_successful_publish.webp"
    className="rounded-lg"
    />

## Current Limitations
1. Does not convert an image sequence to a video like it does if you are publishing from the State Manager.
    - If you select an image sequence, it will only upload the first image. You don’t want to have a ton of posts flooding your channel. In the future, I might address this by doing an auto convert but we shall see if it’s necessary.
