## OAuth Bot Token
Token input is placed in the Studio tab if Studio enabled. If its not, then its placed in the Project tab. 
You will only be able to input the token, you wonâ€™t be able to access it from here. So no one could theoretically rip it out. 
The token is stored in a json file at the Studio Path location. Otherwise itâ€™s stored in the Project Pipeline json.

## Server
### Settings
In the Server section, enter your App-Level Token from the appâ€™s information page on the Slack Developer site.
This uses the same method as the Bot OAuth Token above and can only be entered via the button below the text field.  
  
You may start the server from this section, but note:
- If the server is already running, it will not restart.

- If the server is not running locally or remotely, the Start Server button will be active, but starting it may fail.
  
  
### Prism Tray
With this plugin, you are able to check the status of the server in the Prism Tray. Just open the context menu of the tray,
navigate to the Slack menu and in it you will be provided with the following:
<img
    src="/images/prism/slack/server_settings_tray.webp"
    className="round-lg"
    />  

From here you can see if the Slack Bolt Server isrunning by indicating it with a visual cue, and the current status. These are the current status':  
- âœ… Running
- ðŸš« Not Running  
  
You can choose to either Start or Stop the server as well. These commands will trigger a local server session to popup in the terminal.  
  
<Note>The server will not start if it is running. However if you know it's not running and can't start it, you can navigate to the Prism Settings window and choose: Reset Server. You can also do this via command line by using this: [reset_bolt_server_status]()</Note>
