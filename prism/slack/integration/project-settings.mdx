<Note>A single option only appies if you are running Prism+ with Studio enabled</Note>  
There is only one option for Slack in the Project Settings window.
  
  
If you are not running Studio or are not subscribed to Prism+, then all of the Studio options will show up in this window along with the Custom Channel Name field.

You can give a custom channel name to the project so that you can send notifications/publishes to that custom channel instead of one where the channel name is the same as the project name. 
To make sure that you don’t need to align project names with the slack channel names, I’ve enabled the option to allow you to enter a Custom Channel Name. Just follow these steps.

    <Step title="Locate Custom Channel Setting">

        />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Input Custom Channel Name">
        Input the channel name you want to send your content.

            className="rounded-lg"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify the Custom Channel">
        Press the Verify button. If it passed the check, it will store that information in the project pipeline file and change the button to Verified.
