## Publish
  
### Standard
This is the simple interface that gets published with the file that gets uploaded. 
The artist who uploads the file will get tagged directly. This will allow them to be notified if someone makes any comments or reactions to it.

## Notifications
  
### Standard
All notifications will popup to their respected channels and let everyone know that there is an incoming update for renders. 
This will look relatively the same based on the option for Channel or Direct messages.

### Ephermal
Notifications sent Ephemerally will post to the channel or direct messages and look like this. This lets only the user who got notified see the post.
